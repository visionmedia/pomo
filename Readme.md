# Pomo  

  Command-line application for the [Pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) time management technique.
  
## Description

With Pomo you can add, remove, list, view, and start timing tasks all via the 
command-line with a simple, slick interface. You are reminded of the remaining 
time on a task via Growl. These notifications appear half-way, at the 5 minute point, 
and when the task duration has expired. 

## Installation

    $ gem install pomo
    
## Task Selection API

Taken from `pomo help`:

    Most of the subcommands work directly with tasks,
    and because of this pomo provides a unified task selection api
    shown below which can be used with most of the commands 
    (those with [task ...] in their synopsis). 
  
    n          : selects a single task by index : Ex: pomo remove 1
    [n ]+      : selects several tasks by index : Ex: pomo remove 2 8 1
    n..n       : selects a range of tasks       : Ex: pomo remove 5..9
    n..-n      : selects a range of tasks       : Ex: pomo remove 2..-1
    first      : selects the first task         : Ex: pomo remove first
    last       : selects the last task          : Ex: pomo remove last
    complete   : selects complete tasks         : Ex: pomo remove complete
    incomplete : selects incomplete tasks       : Ex: pomo remove incomplete
    all        : selects all tasks              : Ex: pomo remove all

## Examples

  * View global or command specific help:

        $ pomo help
        $ pomo help add
        $ pomo help remove

  * Get started by adding a task:

        $ pomo add "Fix IE stying issues"
    
    And another:

        $ pomo add "Destroy IE" --description "because IE is terrible"
    
  * List your tasks (or use `pomo` which defaults to `pomo list`):

        $ pomo list
            0. Fix IE stying issues                : 25 minutes
            1. Destroy IE                          : 25 minutes

  * Start the first incomplete task:

        $ pomo start
        Started Fix IE stying issues, you have 25 minutes :)
        (=........................) 24 minutes remaining
    
  * Once you have completed the task, list again:

        $ pomo list
          ✓ 0. Fix IE stying issues                : 25 minutes
            1. Destroy IE                          : 25 minutes
        
  * Or take a break:

        $ pomo break
        $ pomo break 10
        $ pomo break --length 10
        
  * List only remaining tasks:

        $ pomo list --incomplete
            1. Destroy IE                          : 25 minutes
        
  * List only completed tasks:

        $ pomo list --complete
          ✓ 0. Fix IE stying issues                : 25 minutes

  * At any time mid-task you may terminate pomo via CTRL + C, at which
    time you may manually complete the task:

        $ pomo complete first
        $ pomo complete last
        $ pomo complete 1
        $ pomo complete all
        $ pomo complete incomplete
        $ pomo complete 5..7

  * The next time you run `pomo start` the first incomplete task
    will start:

        $ pomo start
    
    Or choose a specific task:

        $ pomo start first
        $ pomo start last
        $ pomo start 5
    
  * You may also remove tasks:

        $ pomo remove first
        $ pomo remove last
        $ pomo remove 2
        $ pomo remove 1
        $ pomo remove 6
        $ pomo rm first
        $ pomo rm 2..5
        $ pomo rm 1..-1
    
  * View task details:

        $ pomo view first
        $ pomo view last
        $ pomo view 5
        $ pomo view 1 2 3

  * Remove all tasks:

        $ pomo remove all
        $ pomo rm all

  * Or if you prefer, create a directory specific task list. Pomo will
    auto-detect `./.pomo` in this directory, and utilize its contents.

        $ pomo init
